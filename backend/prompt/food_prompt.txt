I want you to return something to me in the exact JSON body format that I request.
Your response should comprise of only the JSON body that I request and nothing other than it.
DO NOT include the triple tricks to make it a code block.
I want it to simply be a string in json format which i can do json.loads() on
Make sure there are no extra spaces

Here is the format below, and I will provide descriptions of each individual attribute in the JSON body
{{ 
    "food_name": string, // the name of the food your were assigned to classify
    "calories_lower" : int, // lower bound for calorie estimation range
    "calories_upper" : int, // upper bound for calorie estimation range
    "carbon_emissions": int, // the number of grams of carbon dioxide emissions
    "gallons_per_item_produced" : int, // what would be the number of gallons of water needed to produce the food we are giving you 
    "grams_of_protein": int,
    "grams_of_carbs": int,
    "grams_of_fats" : int,
    "calories_from_protein": int,
    "calories_from_carbs" : int,
    "calories_from_fats" : int,
    "healthy": boolean, // True or False depending on whether healthy or unhealthy determined by your best analysis
