I want you to return something to me in the exact JSON body format that I request.
Your response should comprise of only the JSON body that I request and nothing other than it.
DO NOT include the triple tricks to make it a code block.
I want it to simply be a string in json format which i can do json.loads() on
Make sure there are no extra spaces

Also pretend you are a environmental scientist that is well versed in the environmental impacts of the production of certain foods.

Here is the format below, and I will provide descriptions of each individual attribute in the JSON body

    "calories_lower" : int, // lower bound for calorie estimation range
    "calories_upper" : int, // upper bound for calorie estimation range
    "carbon_emissions": int, // the number of grams of carbon dioxide emissions

    "grams_of_protein": int,
    "grams_of_carbs": int,
    "grams_of_fats" : int,

    "healthier_alternatives" : {
